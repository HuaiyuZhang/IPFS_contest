# IPFS data modeling contest

---

## Description

Your company wants to better understand why a loan cancels before its maturity date.

*Cancelled Loan = a loan that “cancels” before its maturity date. 
The loan could be requested
to cancel by the agent or borrower or cancel due to payment default on the loan.*

In addition to gaining the understanding of why a loan cancels, IPFS leadership would like for you to
build a model predicting whether or not a loan is likely to cancel. This model could later be placed into
production to help associates monitor their books of business for possible cancellations, potentially
preventing them from cancelling and saving the company a loss of income.
For this project, your boss has asked that you complete a technical summary outlining your
understanding of a cancelled loan and the factors that could help predict a loan’s cancellation .
Additionally, she wants you to produce a model predicting whether a loan is likely to cancel, 
based on loan, agent, and borrower data.
